        .SYNOPSIS
        Delete more than 10 items using Compliance Search Action - Single mailbox scenario 

        .DESCRIPTION
        Provide an automated way to delete more than 10 items from a particular mailbox using Compliance Search Action.
        This works only for Compliance Searches targeting a single mailbox.
        
        .EXAMPLE
        Create a Compliance Search from Compliance Portal to target a specific mailbox, inspect the search results to confirm your search criteria returned the expected items that you wish to delete.
        If the returned items count is more than 10, you can start this script to automate the deletion of those items.
